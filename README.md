# node-red-contrib-uimaker

This is the repostory for `uimaker` for node-red. It's composed of two package:

- [`node-red-contrib-uimaker`](./nodes/): Package that contains the nodes to use with node-red
- [`uimaker-client`](./client): The client library that allow you to comunicate with the nodes from node-red

`UIMaker` allow you to create dashboard with node-red. However, `UIMaker` does not come with any UI toolkit, it's up to you to use whatever you want. Also, the client library is framework-agnostic, you can use any frontend you want or no framework at all.

### What's missing

- Tests
- Typescript types definition in the package for the client
- Better examples
- ???
